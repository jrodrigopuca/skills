# Create Development Guide

## Responsibilities

- describe prerequisites and local setup
- document environment variables when evidenced
- list real run, test, lint, and build commands
- mention operational and safety notes for development
- record common issues visible from the repository
- preserve still-valid setup and workflow instructions when updating existing docs

## Required Inputs

- the selected `{scope}` and scope boundaries
- scripts, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, CI config, or task runners relevant to local development
- environment variable sources such as config files or examples
- scope analysis results and confidence notes
- the existing `{scope}/docs/development-guide.md` when operating in `update` or `reconcile` mode

## Expected Output

Produce a **Document Generation Artifact** for the development guide containing at least:

- `targetPath`: `{scope}/docs/development-guide.md`
- `documentType`: `development-guide`
- `sourcesInspected`
- `confidenceNote`
- `omittedSections` when applicable
- `openQuestions` or `needsConfirmation` when applicable

The generated document must include only commands and setup steps evidenced by the repository, marking unverifiable steps as `Needs confirmation` when omission would hide a real gap.

In `update` or `reconcile` mode, preserve still-correct commands and setup steps, and refresh only the areas changed by current repository evidence.

## Rules

- Never invent commands.
- Prefer commands from scripts, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, CI config, or task runners.
- If a step cannot be verified, label it `Needs confirmation`.
- Include `Sources Inspected`.
- Remove or update stale commands instead of retaining legacy instructions that no longer match the repository.
